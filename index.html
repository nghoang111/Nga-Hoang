							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am Nga Hoang from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I speak Vietnamese, English and Mandarin, where Vietnamese is my native language. I commenced RMIT University in Bachelor of Business Management in Saigon South Campus in 2016. I spent a year in RMIT Melbourne as an exchange student to expand my understanding about the world and expose myself to a diverse cultural environment from 2018. My goal in life is to become a financially successful person whilst also having freedom to do what I enjoy. I also learn Mandarin because of its potential values in the business industry. I enjoy applying what I have learned into everyday situations and discussing or sharing my knowledge with other people that I am acquainted with as I think it is a way to strengthen your understanding, learn new information and make good connections at the same time. </p>

							<h2>Interest in IT </h2>
						</header>
						<h2><i>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</i></h2> 
						<p>I developed my interest in IT when I acknowledge the values it brings to our lives and work. IT plays a key role in any aspect that we are involved with nowadays and every bit in today’s lives can benefit from the application of IT. I am fascinated by that fact and I look at myself to see how IT has impacted me and how I rely on a lot of technology. Therefore, I believe learning or understanding IT can help me achieve my goals in life. I remember sometime back in 2017, I heard about big data and I have no clue in mind of what it is or how it is used in real life. In 2018, again, I saw it while working in a subject and had an idea of how big it benefits are to the world. Aligning to my major, Business Management, there are wide areas there that need the help of big data. Therefore, I decide to learn more about how big data helps with actively customer service.</p>
						<h2><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2></i> 
						<p>My high school has good connection with RMIT, so our class is offered an introduction tour to RMIT University. I got the chance to visit the campus and participate in some interesting activities that made me wanted to be part of this organization so much. Therefore, after graduated high school, I apply to RMIT with the belief that I can benefit from its teaching method, professional environment and good connections with fellow students.  </p>
						<h2><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2></i> 
						<p>I expect to learn about how theory and how it is applied. I want to understand more IT concepts, examples and its potential applications.</p>

								<h3>Job Advertisement (2)</h3>
								<p>Source: https://www.enworld.com.vn/job/operations-manager-1/</p>
						</article>
						
						<p>I want to work as an administrative officer after I graduated, and my dream is to become an operation manager. An operation manager responsible for overseeing the administrative activities that promote the smooth flow of an office, organizing staffs, information and other resources (AGCAS & Graduate Prospects 2019). 

								In this case, the job is operation manager for Navigos Search, a company belongs to Navigos Group. Beside Navigos Search, the corporation also owns the recruiting websites Vietnamworks.  
								
								This position involves with managing and enhancing the production team whilst also coordinating with other departments like project, product or services department. It also requires regular review of the business procedures and making sure that they align with the organization's goals and values. These works deal with many aspects in an organization, for example, internal and external relationships management, financial management, overwatch performance and environment/infrastructure enhancement.  
								
								This position is very appealing to me in the sense that this is my dream job in the career path. A senior role, requiring high experience, high pressure and hence, high rewards. The company established its reputation in the digital, technology and telecommunication fields in Vietnam, which is significant. Working in this environment, I would learn many exciting things.</p>

						<h2><i>The skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position versus what I currently have.</i></h2>
						<p>Besides a bachelor's degree or other similar academic degrees, this position requires deep and wide experiences in the business world, including three-year or more experience as Operation Head or managerial level positions, understanding of various business procedures and functions, experienced in project management and using business software like ERM and CRM. Moreover, excellent soft skills are also required, for example, communication and people skills. Technical skills are also required, which are organizational and leadership skills, operation modelling and analysis skills, etc. <br>Currently, I am still developing my communication and human skills through experience within the campus. I have experience in teamwork, customer services, internal and external communication and relationship skills from schoolwork and part-time jobs. The qualifications are mostly language qualifications and expected bachelor’s certificate.</p>
						<h2><i>How I can obtain these skills, qualifications and experiences?</i></h2>
						<p>As a student in her last semester before I graduated, I believe I should apply for internships and full-time roles to enhance my communication and human skills. The diverse environment will help greatly in improving and strengthen these skills. At the same time, I will also earn more knowledge about the business world and how it works and the differences from company to company. Moreover, I should be acquainted to and learn to excel in business programs like CRM and ERM at the same time.</p>

								<h3>Skills demand, 2018 vs 2022, top ten</h3>
								<p>Source: World Economic Forum 2018</p>
						</article>
						<p>In order to improve my chance to find an stable employment in this occupation in the future, I believe I should find out how to fill up the gap between my current self and the ideal self that the industry needs and what attitude to keep in mind when the future of work is changing in an uncertain pattern.  

								<br>Companies do not always look for quantitative indicators, they also focus on the potential of candidate as “there is no correlation to how well someone does on the job to how they do on the interview” (Higgs, cited in Karpis 2018). According to World Economic Forum (2018), key skills demand trend by 2022 include analytical thinking and innovations and active learning and learning strategies followed with creativity, critical thinking and problem solving. In order to develop these skills, I will join RMIT Business Club’s administration team and pursue until I could get to be a project leader where I can experience and build my problem-solving skills, creativity and emotional intelligence when dealing with a small-scope team. Further on my personal development, I will focus more on observation aspect, ask more questions, build a reading goal of at least one to two books per month and play brain games to work on analytical thinking skills (Listmann, cited in the wiki article ‘How to Improve Analytical Skills’ 2019). With my strengths in self-regulation and perseverance, I believe I can achieve these goals. 
								
								<br>Further, I believe active and lifelong learning is one of the most important criteria to success, especially when technology is changing our lives at exponential rate. Thus, it is crucial for me to bear in mind that learning is an ongoing process and if I stop keeping it up, I am moving backward. Additionally, one of my values of learning also coincide as I like the opportunity to learn new things. What education institutions are doing is, not only transferring the knowledge but also educate people on how to learn, what is the best learning method for each individual as one method cannot apply for everyone (Miller 2017).  
								
								<br>To that might be added, we also need to look at the spirit and attitude toward the augmented future of work, in which I think open-minded and readiness are vital. Adaptability and flexibility are skills that also need to be developed, but the drive behind those skills is one’s will to change and adapt to a changing external environment. As discussed by Oppong (2018), what are considered important and value today might not worth a dime tomorrow, I need to prepare and upgrade myself to become a value asset to any organization I work in.</p>

								<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
								<p>‘The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.’ - Source: https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality </p>

								<h3>Creativity test</h3>
								<p>Creativity test</p>
							</article>
							<h2><i>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</i></h2>
							<p>The results say that I am supportive, reliable and patient, imaginative and observant, enthusiastic, loyal and hardworking and have good practical skills. However, being humble, shy, take things too personally, repressing my feelings are my obstacles. This implies that sometimes it is important for me to stand up and speak for myself instead of holding thoughts and feelings inside. Further, I should not let feelings dominate my decision-making process, I should be able to distinguish personal and impersonal things. Overcoming these obstacles will help me bloom in my career and relationship paths. <br>My learning styles, based on the VAK model, are somewhat balanced between visual, auditory and kinesthetic. This means that I learn more effectively and remember better information that is presented visually and in auditory form like graphs, charts, mind maps and team discussions. <br>The creativity test result shows that mine is slightly above typical. In which, the ability to simultaneously accept and work with statements that are contradictory; and, to carry large quantities of information and be able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information have the highest metrics. Whereas the ability to shift one's perspective on a situation - in terms of space and time, and other people; and, to force oneself to keep trying to derive more and stronger solutions even when good ones have already been generated are those weaker metrics.</p>
							<h2><i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i></h2>
							<p>With these characteristics and skills, I might encounter multiple issues in a team. For example, I will not actively input my completed ideas for the group as a result from repressing my feeling. On the other hand, I would be very helpful, supportive and enthusiastic to every task assigned and will take responsibility for those. Moreover, I might find it hard to follow instructions or ideas presentations without visual graphics or animated videos. Thus, I need more time to participate in a group discussion to full capture the ideas from everybody. Finally, I could make use of various data and manage their relations to bring more creative task. However, once there is a solution to one problem, I would just accept the solution and not continue to strive for another one.</p>
							<h2><i>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </i></h2>
							<p>Incorporating all the above factors, I should refer to logical arguments instead of feelings and act on them when forming a group. For example, I should be hiring people that fit the team’s goal and help diverse the skill sets among members rather those who I have feeling for and find hard to reject them. Moreover, I need to find people with different learning styles or dominant in one learning style. The reason being that this increase the possibility that the team get the concept quicker than all members have one learning style. Further, as my creativity is not as high, I should look for people with higher result or better than mine in my weak metrics. All of these make sure that the team skills are balanced, even and not tilt to one end.</p>

							<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
						</header>
						<h2><i>Overview </i></h2>
						<p>This project aims to develop a web application which enables users to interact with their favorite skincare blogger/vlogger. It will allow users to log in, sign up, real time chat, post messages and interact with other posts. It helps the skincare blogger/vlogger to increase interactions with their followers, build sustainable relationship while sharing valuable knowledge and tips from their experiences to others.</p>
						<h2><i>Motivation</i></h2>
						<p>Nowadays, people are more attentive to their outlook and appearance, especially their face and skin. According to Park and Nam (2012), the awareness about skin health is not just for women but men also care about their skin as there are more male visit skin treatment facilities. Skincare is not only about beauty, but it is also about health. Based on a study in England, skin diseases like skin cancer and melanoma are increasing (Vallejo-Torres et al. 2014). Therefore, with decent care and protection, it helps prevent those skin diseases. The skincare industry has grown enormously, multiple brands and products, the competition is great and so is the profitability. According to Euromonitor (2019), the industry records current value growth at 1% in 2018 to reach approximately KRW7,100 billion and is still expected to growth by 2023 in Korea. One of the key players in the industry is social influencers like beauty bloggers and vloggers. They share their experiences and knowledge on the internet and social media platforms. As they reached the crowd and increase popularity, big players in the industry will offer them a partner contract and through their popularity, business can sell more goods and increase brand awareness while the consumers benefit from the information shared. Thus, an application where beauty influencers can interact to their followers is important. It supports the bloggers and vloggers to reach to and take care of their existing followers and answer questions send directly from them. They can maintain the interactions, share more specified information to a direct group and thus, enhance their popularity.</p>
						<h2><i>Description</i></h2>	
						<p>IThe web application will allow users to register as a new user and to log in their account. They can then customize their profile page and input more personal information. The features of this application are post message, reply to message, like and dislike message, comment on a post, delete a post and real time chat with the host influencer. They can then post a message on the message board and other users can then reply to the post. They can also like or dislike other messages on the message board. When the host influencer wished to open the public real time chat, users can post questions and communicate with the host instantly.</p>
						<h2><i>Tools and techniques</i></h2>
						<p>The messaging chat application will be developed using Google Firebase and its resources, for example, Firebase Realtime database, Firebase Firestore, Firebase functions and Firebase hosting. The software involving are Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, Slack and Trello. The hardware involving are personal computers and mobile devices.</p>
						<h2><i>Skills required </i></h2>
						<p>The skills involved are user interface design, cross-browser web application development, backend computing and programming language skills. User interface design skills will help with building a high-quality user interface, which will help the users interact effectively with the app. People would more likely enjoy a user-friendly with superior design and run smoothly app than a poor user interface one (Toth 2017). Moreover, the ability to build the web application that works across browsers, such as Chrome and Safari, is also important. It helps expand the possibilities and opportunities for the app. Backend computing, which involves security, database management and hardware interaction, is also important. Everything involving IT involves security issues, thus, security knowledge is essential while developing the app. Hence, skills involving Firestore NoSQL and Google Cloud Function would be a good example. Finally, programming language is also important. According to Toth (2017), the developer needs to be familiar with programming languages like C# and Java and to be trained in web development languages like HTML 5 and CSS. For example, React JS skill for frontend JavaScript and Node JS for backend JavaScript. Therefore, a team of diverse expertise members, such as security, programming, UI design, etc., would be fantastic to develop this app. Teamwork, communication and constructive thinking are the crucial soft skills that help them run the team together.</p>
						<h2><i>Outcome </i></h2>
						<p>This application will allow social media influencers to have a customized channel to interact with their followers, to take care of them and to maintain the interactions. They can answer questions related to sensitive topics that they do not want to disclose publicly just to receive unwanted criticisms. For example, topics like which brands or products they do not like or do not work, which service provider do they go to get something done, etc. Something they would share out of their pure experience, but somebody would see it as an advertisement or a bullying act. With this application, they now have a more secure and private channel to stay connected and share more valuable information with those who really in need.</p>
